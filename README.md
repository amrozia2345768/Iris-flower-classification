# Iris-flower-classification
A machine learning project that classifies iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on petal and sepal measurements using various classification algorithms. After preparing the data, various classification algorithms (like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) are applied and evaluated to determine the most accurate model.
Key Features:
Manual loading of the dataset (alternative to using sklearn.datasets)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization
Feature scaling and label encoding
Model training with multiple ML algorithms
Accuracy comparison and confusion matrix visualization
